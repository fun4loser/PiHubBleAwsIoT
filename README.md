# PiHubBleAwsIoT

Turns a Raspberry Pi into a hub for Adafruit Feather Bluefruit LE (Bluetooth low energy) devices.

When run, it will scan the area for Feathers, register them and set their respective states to a shared global.
The idea is that any of the registered Feathers can set the state for all others. This is a bit different than traditional
master-slave (a la Phillips Hue) in that all BLE devices are state machines and changing the state of any
one of them can change the state of all (of course, the states don't need to map to the same color/function!)

This code also adds AWS IOT functionality so that multiple PiHubs can talk via MQTT.

## Configuration

Edit the PiHub.cfg file before running.

## Troubleshooting

The biggest PITA for me was figuring out the handle for RX notifications. [This post](https://github.com/IanHarvey/bluepy/issues/83) describes how to find it. My notes (for posterity):

> Turn on hcidump and run bluetoothctl. Connect to Feather, select the RX characteristic and set notify on. Then touch a wire (to send data). Hopefully, Iâ€™ll see how it turned on notifications.
> YES!!!!
> The hcidump showed me this:
```2017-07-29 14:29:03.106911 < ACL data: handle 64 flags 0x00 dlen 9
    ATT: Write req (0x12)
      handle 0x0023 value  0x01 0x00
```
> 0x0023 is 35
> Add this to my code and it works
```print(self.p.writeCharacteristic(35, b"\x01\x00", withResponse=True))```

> So what is 35? Well according to btle.py for this feather, UART handles can be between 31 and 38. I've seen 37 documented elsewhere, which caused me hours of pain
```
Service <uuid=6e400001-b5a3-f393-e0a9-e50e24dcca9e handleStart=31 handleEnd=38> :
    Characteristic <6e400003-b5a3-f393-e0a9-e50e24dcca9e>, hnd=0x20, supports NOTIFY
    Characteristic <6e400002-b5a3-f393-e0a9-e50e24dcca9e>, hnd=0x24, supports WRITE
```
